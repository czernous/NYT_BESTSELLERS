# NYT_BESTSELLERS

This app connects to the New York Times Books API to get all the current bestselling books.

It's built with Express, GraphQL, Apollo Server, and EJS on the back end as well as a simple Bootstrap template on the front end.

There is also a dummy login form that isn't connected to any back end as it is provided only for demo puproses. It accepts hardcoded username : 123 and password: 123.

Deployed to Heroku at https://getbestsellers.herokuapp.com/
